*When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

-I would want to create a remote repository when I'm ready to share my work with my 
collegues or I am stuck and need help.

*Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

-Because if git automatically pulls from the remote repository it will
constantly change the code base and you dont want that since it will cause 
confusion when you are working to fix a bug or adding a new feature.

*Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

-Fork are used to copy repositorys on GitHub. You would use forks to make a change 
on a repository on GitHub. Clones are used to copy repositories to your local machine.
You would use it to have online access to repositories you've cloned off of GitHub.
Branches are used to help you implement features and to fix bugs since branches will not 
affect how to master functions. You would use branching to collaborate with other people 
or help implement a function you are not too sure about.

*What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

-The benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally is that
you risk pulling a new commit if you dont know.

*How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

-I would use Git and GitHub eventually once I have gotten a better understanding of how to use it.
Using DropBox would be much easier than Github but then there would be room for a lot of mistakes
is people are not careful.

*When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

-I would make changes in a sepatate branch rather than in the master if I wanted to test an idea further
and get feed back from collaborates via pull requests to make a final decision.

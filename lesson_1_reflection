*How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that 
was introduced?

-It was easier to spot the typo when viewing only the differences 
between the files otherwise it would have become very tedious to look for the bug.

*How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?

-You would not have to worry about manually backing up your files
and could easily go back to a version that was working rather than having 
to find the bug or start over.

*What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, 
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

-Con is that you have to do it manually and pro is that it is far more accurate
for programming purposes to manually save your files and add a little comment about what
you fixed in that version. 

*Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files 
in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

-Because multiple files that are closely related are more prevalent in programming 
rather than non programming applications. So it would make sense to save all the files
that involve one another rather than saving files that have nothing to do with each other.

*How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

You can use git log to see all the commits that have been made on a project. And you can then use
git diff to compare those commits to see what exactly was added or changed.

*How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

-Because I would have peace of mind knowing that anything i do can be fixed. Also, it would help me when
I make mistakes and rather than having to go back and fix them I could just go back to a version that worked
and begin anew.

*Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

-I want to use fit for working on a group project together with my team mates.
